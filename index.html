                        in
                        the video game industry by producing a creative adventurous sandbox video game, allowing players
                        to
                        create, craft and mine. His passion for developing and producing a virtual Lego game, with
                        endless
                        building possibilities, kept him engaged with programming to such an extent that he dropped out
                        from
                        high school.</p>

                    <h2>Goals</h2>
                    <p>I always love to collect minimal and modern furniture for my home and specially for my work
                        place.
                        Due to covid situation as I need to work from home so now a days it’s mandatory for me to think
                        more
                        creatively within my work place. so, minimal colored furniture will help me a lot in this case.

                    <h2>Needs</h2>
                    <p>Current app UI is messy. I think need to improve the app user interface. So that all information
                        can
                        be found organized and easy to navigate. Also need to show the order process in a modern way.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Pain Points</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Can’t find the size of the product directly from the app user interface.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I can’t track my order properly.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            There is no option to make a report for the product issue.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I can’t find the return option from the app user
                            interface.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Current app interface is really hard to navigate and browse as all informations are not
                            organized here.
